# NeuroTech: Moodie Data Test

- It is a Computer Engineering 3rd year term project for Gebze Technical University.

## Objective
- We are developing and deploying a wearable sensor to measure brain activity. We use infrared light to non-invasively measure changing oxygen concentration in the user’s brain, and relate this to changes in the user’s condition by using the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique.
- Our product "Moodie" measures users' emotional changes during movies and TV series and reports these changes to the user statistically.
- To test the hardware and collect data, we developed this python code. It collects the device data while watching test videos and stores the results for each test user.
